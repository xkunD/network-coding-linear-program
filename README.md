#  Network Coding Analysis & Steiner Tree Packing Approximation
This repository hosts a research project with Prof. Tang at Cornell ECE, dedicated to the development of a polynomial time approximation algorithm for Steiner Tree Packing  from a network coding perspective. Another focus is proving the conjecture that multi-session unicast networks hold no network coding advantage over traditional routing methods.
